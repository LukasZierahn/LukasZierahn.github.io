I'm part of the [Italian National PhD program in AI](https://www.phd-ai.it/en/359-2/) supervised by [Nicol√≤ Cesa-Bianchi](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/) and [Gergely Neu](http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/). My program started in November 2021 and I'm expect to finish in November of 2024. 

I graduated with an MSc in "Data Science and Machine Learning" from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with Distinction in 2021 and an BSC in "Mathematics" from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) with First-Class Honours in 2020.

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar and [chess](https://lichess.org/@/YasoKuhl).
